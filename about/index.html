<br>
I am a fourth year PhD student studying Statistics at the University of Madison, Wisconsin. I currently serving as a <a href="https://calslab.cals.wisc.edu/stat-consulting/">statistical consultant</a> to the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, I am interested in studying statistics and dynamics on networks, and causal inference. I also promote transparency, understandability, and healthy communities in statistics.

<br><br>
I am immensely privileged to be mentored by Professor <a href=https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/%7Epll28/index.html> Po-Ling Loh</a>. I am currently supported by a pre-doctoral <a href="https://biostat.wiscweb.wisc.edu/education/predoctoral-training-program-in-bio-data-science-bds/"> Bio-Data Science Training Grant </a> from the National Library of Medicine.
