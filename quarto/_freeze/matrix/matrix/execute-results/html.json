D^{\\dagger}A$\n\n## Stochastic Matrices\n\nmatrices in which each matrix row sums to 1.\n\n## Matrix Norms\n\nThis section aims to quantify and give intuition behind the following matrix norms.\n\n-   spectral\n-   frobenius\n-   $L^n$\n\n## Matrix differentials\n\n### Example: Trace\n\nMatrix differentials are confusing as hell, but normally we want to optimize some functions by linearizing around some point. That is if we perturb the matrix at some particular point, what is the effect that we'll see?\n\nThe animals of the derivative zoo are plenty. We can define the derivative of a function that is a combination of scalar, vector, matrix *arguments* with scalar, vector, matrix *results*. This makes the concept of the differential (and derivative) confusing because the layout of where the derivatives are all different. What's worse, is that authors generally don't agree on the form that these derivatives should take,\n\nLet's take the example of a *matrix* argument, with a *scalar* output. For the first example, let's take a _linear_ function and show how the derivative can give us an approximation of the perturbation. Suppose $f(X) = \\mathrm{tr}(AX)$ where $A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$ is some given constant matrix, and $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}$. \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{D}f = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\, f}{\\mathrm{d}X} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\,\\mathrm{tr}(AX)}{\\mathrm{d}X} = \\begin{cases}\nA & \\text{numerator layout} \\\\\nA' & \\text{denominator layout} \\\\\nA' & \\text{mixed layout} \\\\\n(\\mathrm{vec}A')' & \\text{vectorized layout}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis notation reads \"the derivative of $f$ with respect to X\", and I think it's quite bad. We note that the _differential_ is much more clear about the effect of a perturbation. \n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{d}\\,\\mathrm{tr}(AX) =  \\mathrm{tr} (A\\,\\mathrm{d}X)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nLet's let $A = \\begin{bmatrix}4 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 2\\end{bmatrix}$ and just so I can plot the surface, $X = \\begin{bmatrix}x & 2 \\\\ y & -1\\end{bmatrix}$. If I vary both $x$ and $y$, I can plot some surface with components $(x, y, f(X))$.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='matrix_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-34_743f8e1ea0eba5049f6a91afe027e73c'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nA

we want to know $f(X + H)$ using our nicely calculated derivatives, we should have some taylor series looking approximation, linearization\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(X + U) = f(X) + \\fbox{?(U)?} + R(H)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the remainder dependent on $U$ that goes to 0 faster than linear. Roughly we know that $\\fbox{?U?}$, should be a function of the step $U$. Most of the forms of Taylor's theorem I've seen don't work here because $U$ is a matrix.\n\n- $f(x + a) = f(x) + af'(x) + R(a)$ (scalar -> scalar)\n- $f(\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}) = f(\\mathbf{x}) + \\mathbf{a}'\\nabla f(x) + R(\\mathbf{a})$ (vector -> scalar)\n- $f(\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}) = f(\\mathbf{x}) + \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\nabla f(x) + R(\\mathbf{a})$  (vector -> scalar)\n- $f(\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}) = f(\\mathbf{x}) + \\langle \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}), \\mathbf{a}\\rangle + R(\\mathbf{a})$ (vector -> scalor)\n- $f(X + U) = f(\\mathbf{x}) + \\langle D f(X), U\\rangle + R(\\mathbf{a})$ (matrix -> scalar)\n\nSince $\\mathrm{tr}$ is linear in this case, we can figure out what the answer _should_ be,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{tr}(A(X + H)) &= \\mathrm{tr}(AX) + \\mathrm{tr}(AH) \\\\\n&=  \\mathrm{tr}(AX) + \\langle A', H\\rangle_F \\\\\n&=  \\mathrm{tr}(AX)+  \\mathrm{vec(A')}'\\mathrm{vec}(H)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\langle A, H\\rangle$ is the standard inner product on real valued matrices (frobenius innner product).\n\nThe easiest method I see is just substitude $H$ for $\\mathrm{d}X$ in the differential equation, so something like:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(X + U) = f(X) + \\mathrm{d}f\\big|_{\\mathrm{d}X = U} \\\\\nf(X + U) = f(X) + \\langle Df, U\\rangle\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe inner product formulation also works quite well and gets us the right answer when using the _denominator_ or _mixed_ layout of derivative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Example: Determinant\n\nNow let's walk through an example that is not a linear function, something more interesting like the determinant of the [gram matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_matrix). \n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ng(X) &=|X'X| \\\\\n\\mathrm{d}g &= 2|X'X|\\,\\mathrm{tr}\\left[\\mathrm{(X'X)^{-1}X'\\mathrm{d}X}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe linear approximation is thus,\n\n$$\ng(X + U)\\approx |X'X| + 2|X'X|\\mathrm{tr}\\left[(X'X)^{-1}X'U\\right] \n$$\nwhile the quadratic approximation is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ng(X+U)&\\approx g(X) + \\mathrm{d}g(X) + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{d}^2g(X) \\\\\n&\\approx |X'X| + 2|X'X|\\mathrm{tr}\\left[(X'X)^{-1}X'U\\right] + \\\\ &\\qquad \\left(2|X'X|\\mathrm{tr}\\left[(X'X)^{-1}X'U\\right]\\right)\\mathrm{tr}\\left[(X'X)^{-1}X'U\\right] + \\\\&\\qquad \n|X'X|\\mathrm{tr}\\left[-(X'X)^{-1}(X'U +U'X)(X'X)^{-1}X'U + U'(X'X)^{-1}U\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nJust so we can plot the thing, again we're constraining the matrix to be $X=\\begin{bmatrix}x & 2 \\\\ -1 & y\\end{bmatrix}$. Let's do the approximation at $x=y=1$, so $X = \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & 1\\end{bmatrix}$, and extend the approximation by $dx = dy = 1$ in each direction, so $U=\\begin{bmatrix}dx & 0 \\\\ 0 & dy\\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='matrix_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-36_ee7421833cb367b34fb2bdd471416d7a'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nA <- matrix(c(4, 2, \n              3, 2), ncol = 2, byrow =
