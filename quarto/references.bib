  abstract = {Beautifully written and elegantly presented, this book is based on 10 lectures given at the CBMS workshop on spectral graph theory in June 1994 at Fresno State University. Chung's well-written exposition can be likened to a conversation with a good teacher - one who not only gives you the facts, but tells you what is really going on, why it is worth doing, and how it is related to familiar ideas in other areas. The monograph is accessible to the nonexpert who is interested in reading about this evolving area of mathematics.},

  abstract = {Let G be a finite undirected graph with no loops or multiple edges. We define the Laplacian matrix of G,Δ(G)by Δij= degree of vertex i and Δij−1 if there is an edge between vertex i and vertex j. In this paper we relate the structure of the graph G to the eigenvalues of A(G): in particular we prove that all the eigenvalues of Δ(G) are non-negative, less than or equal to the number of vertices, and less than or equal to twice the maximum vertex degree. Precise conditions for equality are given.},

After describing the general principles of the refinement-individualization paradigm and proving its validity, we explain how it is implemented in several of the key programs. In particular, we bring the description of the best known program nauty up to date and describe an innovative approach called Traces that outperforms the competitors for many difficult graph classes. Detailed comparisons against saucy, Bliss and conauto are presented.},
