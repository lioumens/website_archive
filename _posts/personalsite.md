A lot of people have talked about how having web presence is fairly important in
this day in age. I tend to agree, but there are still a few things to keep in
mind to avoid "over doing" that presence. I'll talk about some of my observations here.

I have wanted a public presence to make myself a little more accessible to
potential employers and a website seems like the appropriate, modern and personal touch to achieve that. 
However, it is sometimes difficult always be mindful of the balance of personal
and public presence. I'm one of those people that likes to have their privacy
settings as strict as possible. Not that I have things to
hide, but simply because I am more comfortable with more control over the
information that I put out about myself. (I imagine most people are similar in
this regard, just think how contentious government surveillance is!) This is
especially pertinent when people register their own domain and don't use "whois"
protection. Personal information such as address, phone number and email can be
found with the whois utility if not careful.

As I was browsing through some other personal websites for my own ideas, I came across some 
in which they would ask for employment on one page and link entire albums of family vacation photos in another page. (In addition to the aforementioned whois information...)
Seeing these albums made me ask myself "*Are these really appropriate for a
personal website?*" Likely not. If you are asking for employment, your website acts as an
extension of an application, which is no place for family photos.
I'm not saying a personal touch isn't desirable, but I am simply observing that it is always important  *conscious of your
audience and security* .
