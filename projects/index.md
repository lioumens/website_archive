## Technical Papers

* [Statistical Computing Class Final Project](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/lioumens/stat771_final/raw/master/report/liou_771_final.pdf): Fundamentals of Kernel Density Estimation in a computational setting. [Github](https://github.com/lioumens/stat771_final)

## Software

* [SimulateSV](https://github.com/lioumens/simulatesv): Python Package to simulate artificial genomes and structural variations. Mainly used to validate current structural variation software.

## Visualizations

* [Statistics Visualized](https://lioumens.github.io/cool_product/): An interactive visualization of three common statistical concepts, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals and the central limit theroem.

## For Fun

* [Markdown Previewer]({{ site.BASE_PATH }}/mdpreview): Seeing how react.js became so popular, I was curious why the library was making such a splash in the user interface world. This illustrates how fast and reactive the browser can be to user actions. The app renders markdown syntax in real time. Pretty cool! 
* [Game of Life]({{ site.BASE_PATH }}/gameoflife): Who doesn't like the [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)? It's a pretty crude implementation with minimal design foresight, but the app does show some interesting oscillators and still lifes.
