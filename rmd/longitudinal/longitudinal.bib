Since the publication of the bestselling, highly recommended first edition, R has considerably expanded both in popularity and in the number of packages available. Extending the Linear Model with R: Generalized Linear, Mixed Effects and Nonparametric Regression Models, Second Edition takes advantage of the greater functionality now available in R and substantially revises and adds several topics.

@book{pinheiro_mixed-effects_2000,
	title = {Mixed-Effects Models in S and S-{PLUS}},
	isbn = {978-0-387-98957-0},
	abstract = {"This book provides an overview of the theory and application of linearand nonlinear mixed-effects models in the analysis of grouped data,such as longitudinal data, repeated measures, and multilevel data. A unified model-building strategy for both linear and nonlinear models is presented and applied to the analysis of over 20 real datasets froma wide variety of areas, including pharmacokinetics, agriculture, and manufacturing. A strong emphasis is placed on the use of graphical displays at the various phases of the model-building process, starting with exploratory plots of the data and concluding with diagnostic plots to assess the adequacy of a fitted model. Over 170 figures are included in the book. The {NLME} library for analyzing mixed-effects models in S and S-{PLUS}, developed by the authors, provides the underlying software for implementing the methods presented in the text, being described and illustrated in detail throughout the book. The balanced mix of real data examples, modeling software, and theory makes this book a useful reference for practitioners using mixed-effects models in their data analyses. It can also be used as a text for a one-semester graduate-level applied course in mixed-effects models. Researchers in statistical computing will also find this book appealing for its presentation of novel andefficient computational methods for fitting linear and nonlinearmixed-effects models.},
