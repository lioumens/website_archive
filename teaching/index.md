This page is intended to hold a variety of resources that are either helpful to
a future self, or students in similar positions to where I once was. Most of
the material here was born out of either feelings of "Man, I sure wish this
information were easier to find" and "I have no idea what I'm reading right
now, and have completely lost the bigger picture." My emphasis here is "value
added", as I will try not to replicate educational material well documented
elsewhere on the web or in textbooks. Rather, I will point you to those
resources when necessary and elaborate when I find fit.

That said, I really do hope you find these materials helpful, and I would love your feedback as to things you found helpful, and possible improvements (errors or organization). Cheers!
